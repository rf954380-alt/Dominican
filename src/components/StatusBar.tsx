This Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) Policy outlines our procedures for responding to claims of copyright infringement.

Copyright Ownership
All games, applications, images, videos, and other content accessible through our service belong to their respective copyright holders. We do not claim ownership of any third-party content. Our service acts as a technical conduit that allows users to access publicly available internet content.

Safe Harbor Provisions
We operate under the safe harbor provisions of the DMCA (17 U.S.C. § 512). As a service provider that merely transmits, routes, or provides connections for material, we are not liable for copyright infringement by users, provided we respond expeditiously to valid notices.

Filing a DMCA Takedown Notice
A valid notice must include:
  • Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to be infringed
  • Identification of the infringing material and its location (URLs are helpful)
  • Your name, address, telephone number, and email address
  • A good faith statement that the use is not authorized by the copyright owner
  • A statement that the information is accurate, under penalty of perjury
  • Your physical or electronic signature

Send notices to:
  Email: contact@dominicanproxy.com
  Subject: DMCA Takedown Notice

We process valid notices within 48–72 hours of receipt.

Counter-Notification
If content was removed by mistake, you may file a counter-notification including your signature, identification of removed material, a good faith belief statement, your contact information, and consent to jurisdiction.

Repeat Infringer Policy
We terminate accounts of users who are repeat infringers in accordance with the DMCA.

Misrepresentation Warning
Under Section 512(f), knowingly misrepresenting infringing material may result in liability for damages including attorney fees.

Fair Use Considerations
Before submitting a notice, consider whether the use constitutes fair use (criticism, commentary, news reporting, teaching, research). Consult a legal professional if unsure.
